ESP32 S3 Touch Deck macro pad keyboard thing based on the above screen from aliexpress.

Still needs work...like making it go to sleep and wake up on touch....without triggering buttons, why is this seemingly difficult? I don't know!

And hopefully move it from bluetooth to USB HID instead.

And other things!
